# McKean_PathDep
Examples of simulation of path-dependent McKean-Vlasov equations.

This project presents the implementation of the simulations from [Bernou-Liu, Particle method for the numerical simulation of the
path-dependent McKean-Vlasov equation, 2024]. 

Composition:
  - Simulation_OU_v2.ipynb contains the code of our simulation of a modified Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with path-dependency;
  - Neural_masses_v2.ipynb contains the code of our simulation of a neural mass model with potentiation effects.

Files containing particle simulations are available on Zenodo, https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.11656117
