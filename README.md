# McKean_PathDep
Examples of simulation of path-dependent McKean-Vlasov equations.

This project presents the implementation of the simulations from [Bernou-Liu, Particle method for the numerical simulation of the
path-dependent McKean-Vlasov equation, 2024]. Several datasets obtained from those codes are also included.
